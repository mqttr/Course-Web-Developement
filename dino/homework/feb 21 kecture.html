<h1> Lecture Feb 21 </h1>

 
    <p style="color: teal;">I first heard of Antonia on
      what seemed to me an interminable journey across the
      great midland plain of North America.  I was ten 
      years old then; I had lost both my father and mother 
      within a year, and my Virginia relatives were sending 
      me out to my grandparents, who lived in Nebraska.

She's not much older than you, twelve or thirteen, maybe, and she's as bright as a new dollar. Don't you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She's got the pretty brown eyes, too!"</p>
<p style="color: teal; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">This last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down to "Jesse James." Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely to get diseases from foreigners.</p>
<p style="color: teal; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype';">I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day's journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska.</p>
