        <p style="font-weight:bold; font-family: Comic Sans Ms;"> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
        bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
        the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
        conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
        “without pictures or conversations?” </p>
        
        <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
        hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
        picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
        making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
        close by her.</p>
